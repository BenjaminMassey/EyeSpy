# Eye Spy

Copyright 2019 Ben Massey and Michael Welch

## Idea
Video game based on “I Spy” and “Where’s Waldo?” games, where you have to find something specific in a mess of complex scenery. This game will focus on the gimmick of eye tracking: the majority of the input will be gotten from where the player is looking on the screen. The screen will be mainly hidden except for where the player is looking - further adding to challenge of finding the wanted object.

## Implementation
This project is planned to be written entirely in C++. The eye-tracking will be done using OpenCV, as seen in this blog: https://picoledelimao.github.io/blog/2017/01/28/eyeball-tracking-for-mouse-control-in-opencv/ and the graphics and window handling will be using SFML, a simple window and graphics library, similar to the scope of Swing in Java.

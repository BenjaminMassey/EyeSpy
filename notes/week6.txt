Week 6 Notes

This week we started by looking into the documentation of the C++ tools we will be using.
This included going over the guide for openCV eye tracking, and then looking more in depth into general openCV usage.
We have also started to poke around with our graphics library, SFML, which has been limited to the basics of setup so far.
Best news is that we are still fairly confident in our idea, and everything is working smoothly :)

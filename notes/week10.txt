Benjamin Massey / Michael Welch
Final Notes

Here is a breakdown of the division of the workload.

Ben handled the research into OpenCV.  He then wrote the C++ code regarding eye tracking using OpenCV and attempted implementation of improved techniques.

Michael used SFML to create the eye spy game.  He then added code to accommodate eye tracking and calibration.

The eye tracking did not end up working as intended in the end. However the project was still a success in our eyes because we learned a lot about the implementation of visual rendering techniques and image processing.  In addition we set up good ground work for a future project.
